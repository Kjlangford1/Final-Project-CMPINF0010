Abstract: A TLDR summary of the findings of the project. Answer to the question: What is the best neighborhood? And How did you determine that answer (brief summary of metrics)

The best neighborhood in the city of Pittburgh is "Mt. Oliver". We decided this based off of the datasets of COVID-19 cases in the area, Crime Rates in the area, and Car Crashes.  The final metric that we used to gather these datasets together was "Overall Safety", and we felt that even though this was not in the top 20 for the COVID-19 dataset, the other two datasets carried it into the best neighborhood position.
