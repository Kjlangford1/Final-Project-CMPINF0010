Abstract: A TLDR summary of the findings of the project. Answer to the question: What is the best neighborhood? And How did you determine that answer (brief summary of metrics)

The best neighborhood in the city of Pittburgh is "". We decided this based off of the datasets of COVID-19 cases in the area, Crime Rates in the area, and Fires. We also included a subset of Car crashes because we could not originally find enough data for it, but after I had spent around 3 hours counting the dots on the WPRDC map, it would have been a large waste of time. The final metric that we used to gather these datasets together was "", and we felt that the best neighborhood was the best of all of the datasets.
